FASTAPI vs EXPRESS vs NESTJS – QUICK COMPARISON FOR AI BACKENDS

All three can build HTTP APIs, but the real difference is language, ecosystem, and built-in capabilities.

FastAPI (Python):
- Best suited when core AI/ML logic is in Python
- Direct integration with PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI SDKs
- Async by default (ASGI)
- Built-in request validation using Pydantic
- Automatic OpenAPI / Swagger docs with zero setup
- Ideal for model serving, RAG pipelines, embeddings, and inference APIs

Express (Node.js):
- Minimal, unopinionated framework
- Everything is manual: validation, docs, structure
- Great for lightweight APIs and microservices
- Best when app is mostly orchestration of external services
- Not ideal for hosting heavy ML logic directly

NestJS (Node.js + TypeScript):
- Structured, opinionated framework (like Spring/Angular)
- Built-in modules, DI, validation, and Swagger support
- Great for large, enterprise-grade APIs
- Better choice than Express for complex Node backends
- Still relies on external services for ML-heavy workloads

Core Rule:
- If your AI logic and models are in Python → use FastAPI
- If your system is JS/TS-heavy and mostly calls external AI APIs → use NestJS or Express

FastAPI = AI brain service  
NestJS = enterprise API gateway / backend  
Express = lightweight API layer
