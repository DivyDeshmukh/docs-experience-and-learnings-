1. What Happens When You “Build” a Project

When you run:
npm run build
next build
vite build

You are doing this:

Step-by-Step Behind the Scenes

1) TypeScript is checked  
Ensures types are correct  
No runtime code is generated yet, only validation  

2) Linting may run  
Checks code quality and rules  
Finds unused variables, unsafe patterns, etc.  

3) Code is bundled  
All imports are resolved  
Files are merged into optimized bundles  

4) Tree shaking happens  
Unused code is removed  

5) Minification happens  
Variable names shortened  
Spaces removed  
Code compressed  

6) Environment variables are injected  
process.env.X replaced with actual values  

7) Static optimization  
Static pages pre-rendered (Next.js)  
Assets optimized  

8) Final output is created  
Goes into:
.next/ for Next.js  
dist/ for Vite  
build/ for CRA  

This output is what you deploy to production.

--------------------------------------------------

2. What Is Linting

Linting is static code analysis.

It checks your code for:
Logic mistakes  
Unsafe patterns  
Bad practices  
Style issues  
Unused variables  
Missing dependencies in hooks  
Wrong equality checks  

It happens:
At build time  
In your editor while typing  
In CI pipelines  

Linting:
Does not run your code  
Only analyzes it  

--------------------------------------------------

3. What Is ESLint

ESLint is the tool that performs linting in JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

It:
Scans your files  
Applies rule sets  
Shows warnings and errors  

Example ESLint warning:
'data' is assigned a value but never used  

--------------------------------------------------

4. Common ESLint Rule Categories

no-unused-vars  
no-console  
react-hooks/exhaustive-deps  
eqeqeq  
no-undef  
prefer-const  

--------------------------------------------------

5. What Is Prettier (Related But Different)

Prettier is a code formatter, not a linter.

It:
Formats your code automatically  

Handles:
Indentation  
Quotes  
Line width  
Semicolons  

Does NOT detect logic problems  

Best practice:
ESLint for correctness  
Prettier for formatting  

--------------------------------------------------

6. What Is Type Checking (TypeScript)

Type checking:
Ensures function args, return types, and variables match expected types  
Prevents runtime crashes  

Happens during build or via:
tsc --noEmit  

--------------------------------------------------

7. What Is Tree Shaking

Tree shaking removes:
Unused exports  
Dead code  

From your final bundle.

Result:
Smaller JS files  
Faster load times  

--------------------------------------------------

8. What Is Minification

Minification:
Shortens variable names  
Removes whitespace and comments  
Compresses code  

Before:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

After:
function a(n,e){return n+e}

--------------------------------------------------

9. What Is Bundling

Bundling combines:
Your JS files  
Dependencies  
CSS imports  

Into:
One or more optimized production files  

Tools that bundle:
Webpack  
Turbopack  
Vite (Rollup)  
ESBuild  

--------------------------------------------------

10. What Is Source Map

Source maps:
Map minified code back to original code  
Allow debugging production errors in readable form  
Usually disabled or external in production  

--------------------------------------------------
