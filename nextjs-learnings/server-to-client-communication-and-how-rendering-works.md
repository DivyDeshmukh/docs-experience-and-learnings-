# Complete Notes: Next.js Server vs Client Components + Rendering + Deployment + Serialization

---

## 1. Serialization Error in Next.js

### Error
Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components. Classes or other objects with methods are not supported.

### Meaning
- Server Components can only pass data that can be serialized (plain objects, primitives, arrays) to Client Components.
- Functions, class instances, React component functions, and other non-JSON-serializable values cannot be passed as props from Server → Client.

---

## 2. Why This Happens

### Serialization
- Serialization = converting values into a format safe to transfer (generally JSON).
- JSON supports primitives, arrays, and plain objects.
- It cannot represent functions or component definitions.
- React components (function references) are non-serializable.

### Example of invalid data
```js
{ icon: Code2 } // ❌ React component function
````

### Example of valid data

```js
{ title: "Dashboard", count: 123 } // ✅ JSON-serializable
```

---

## 3. Workarounds

### Don’t pass component functions from server to client

Instead:

* Pass strings or keys from server
* Inside the client component, map string keys to actual component references

### Example

```js
{ iconName: "Code2" }
```

Then in client:

```js
const Icon = { Code2, AlertTriangle }[iconName];
```

---

## 4. Server Components vs Client Components

### Default

* Files in `app/` are Server Components by default — run on the server.
* They produce HTML and JSON descriptions for hydration.

### Client Component

* Mark explicitly with `"use client"` at the top.

Needed if:

* You use state (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* You interact with browser APIs (`localStorage`, `window`)
* You handle events (`onClick`) or interactivity

## 5. Server → Client Rules

| Allowed         | Not Allowed           |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Strings         | Functions             |
| Numbers         | Component references  |
| Booleans        | Class instances       |
| Plain objects   | Anything with methods |
| Arrays of above |                       |

---

## 6. Why Serialization Matters

### Concept

* Server Components render HTML + JSON description of UI.
* JSON must be transferable over network.
* Functions and components can’t be turned into JSON.

### Mental Model

```
Server => HTML + JSON (data) => Browser
```

---

## 7. Component Children Passing

### Allowed

Passing rendered JSX elements as children to a Client Component from server:

```jsx
<ClientComp>
  <div>Hello</div>
</ClientComp>
```

Because JSX elements are plain data structures internally.

### Not Allowed

Passing React component functions as children:

```jsx
<ClientComp>
  <MyIcon /> // ❌ if MyIcon is a component function passed from server
</ClientComp>
```

---

## 8. Client → Client Props Passing

If both parent and child are Client Components:

* You can pass functions and component references freely
* This is because both sides execute in the browser

### Example

```jsx
<Button icon={MyIcon} /> // 🟢 both client
```

---

## 9. Server Component Receiving Props

Yes, Server components can receive props — but:

* Props must be JSON-serializable if coming from server boundary
* They can use props to render UI

---

## 10. How Next.js Renders Pages

### Step 1 — Browser Request

```
GET /dashboard
```

### Step 2 — DNS Lookup

* Browser resolves domain to IP via DNS.

### Step 3 — TCP/TLS Handshake

* Establish network connection + encryption.

### Step 4 — Server Receives Request

* Your VM runs Next.js server code.

### Step 5 — Server Renders HTML + JSON

* Runs server components
* Fetches data if needed
* Generates HTML
* Creates JSON describing the UI

### Step 6 — Response Sent

* HTML + JSON sent to browser.

### Step 7 — Browser Displays HTML

* User sees content even before JS runs.

### Step 8 — Hydration (if needed)

* Browser downloads JS bundles for interactive parts and hydrates them.

## 11. Next.js vs CRA Rendering

### CRA (Client-side rendering)

* Server just serves static files
* Browser executes all JS
* React runs entirely in the browser
* Interactivity and UI updates happen client-side

### Next.js Server Rendering

* Server renders initial HTML
* Browser hydrates
* Interactive parts run in browser

---

## 12. CSR vs SSR vs SSG vs ISR

### CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

* Browser fetches JS
* React builds UI
* No server UI rendering

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

* Server renders UI on each request
* HTML sent to browser
* Browser hydrates

### SSG (Static Site Generation)

* Build time rendering
* Static HTML served
* Browser hydrates

---

## 13. Deployment Clarification

### CRA Deployment

* React code is compiled to plain JavaScript
* Static files served by server/CDN
* Browser runs all UI logic

### Next.js Deployment

* Server code runs on Node.js (or edge)
* Some UI rendering may happen on server
* Interactive parts run in browser

---

## 14. Server Execution Environment

### Node.js

* JavaScript runtime
* Runs on server
* Executes JS on server
* Does not include browser APIs (e.g., DOM)

### Browser

* JS runs on browser’s JS engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome)
* Has access to DOM, window, etc.

---

## 15. Language Runtime Clarification

* Node.js uses V8 engine to execute JS on server
* Python uses Python interpreter (not JS)
* Backend language runtime must be present for that language

---

## 16. Data Fetching in SSR / CSR

* In SSR, server fetches data first → then renders HTML
* In CSR, browser fetches data after loading JS
* API calls from browser are executed in browser

---

## 17. Mental Models

### Server

* Produces HTML + JSON
* Can fetch secure data
* Runs pure JS (server logic)

### Browser

* Renders UI
* Runs interactive JS
* Handles user events

---

## 18. Key Analogies

### SSR

Server = Kitchen
Prepares the food (HTML)
Sends food to table (browser)
Customer eats and adds seasoning (JS interactivity)

### CSR

Server = Delivery
Sends recipe and ingredients
Customer cooks and eats

## 19. Flowchart Summary

```
Client Request
    ↓
DNS → Connect
    ↓
Server Receives Request
    ↓
Server Renders UI (SSR) + Data
    ↓
Send HTML + JSON
    ↓
Browser Renders
    ↓
If interactive:
Hydration → JS executes → UI is interactive
```

## 20. Rules for Passing Values Between Components

| From   | To     | Can Pass               |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Server | Client | Only JSON serializable |
| Client | Client | Anything               |
| Server | Server | Anything               |
| Client | Server | Only data via APIs     |
